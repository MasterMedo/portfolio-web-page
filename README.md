# software developer portfolio web application

### description
In search for a job it's a great advantage if one can present all the projects he has worked on in one place. In that regard platforms like LinkedIn and Git are mostly used. A greater effect is accomplished by having all those projects visually presented on ones own web page, often called a portfolio web page.
In this repository we will implement a web application of that sort.
It will use java as a main programming language, java spring MVC for the server side of the application and a git server of some sort used to view code for the projects directly on the website.

### technologies used
1. java programming language
2. java spring MVC
3. javascript
4. git

## documentation
Documentation can be found on the *wiki pages* of this project. It is written in .md file format which is best suited for git repositories. Although there will be a .pdf file every now and then which is just a .md manually converted to .pdf.
*the documentation folder inside this repository is a diploma seminar*
